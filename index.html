      <!--Make the word "humility" bold using <b> tag-->
      These are the few ways we can practice <b>humility</b>. To speak as little as
      possible of one’s self. To mind one’s own business. Not to want to manage
      other people’s affairs. To avoid curiosity. To accept contradictions and
      correction cheerfully. To pass over the mistakes of others. To accept
      insults and injuries. To accept being slighted, forgotten and disliked. To
      be kind and gentle even under provocation. Never to stand on one’s
      dignity. To choose always the hardest.
